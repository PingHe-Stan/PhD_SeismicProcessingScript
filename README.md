# Seismic_Processing_Details
## All the scripts in this repository can only be executed on a specific seismic platform.
### They are used to perform all the seismic signal processing (such as signal-to-noise sifting, rotation, instrumental-response removal, deconvolution, stacking, ray parameter calculation, etc)
#### They are provided to show that I could learn and apply different scripting languages required to perform the signal processing procedures.
